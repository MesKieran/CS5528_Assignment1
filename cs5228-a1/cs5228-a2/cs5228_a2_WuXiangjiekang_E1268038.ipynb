    "## 1 DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is a clustering algorithm used in data mining and machine learning. It is designed to identify clusters in data that may have arbitrary shapes and handle outliers effectively. Here's a more detailed explanation of how the DBSCAN algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Density-Based Clustering:** DBSCAN identifies clusters based on the density of data points in the feature space rather than assuming a specific cluster shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core Points:** The algorithm starts by selecting a random data point. It then checks how many data points are within a specified distance (epsilon or Îµ) from this point. If the number of data points within this distance exceeds a predefined threshold called MinPts (including the data point itself), the selected point is classified as a \"core point.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Border Points:** Data points that are within the epsilon distance of a core point but do not meet the MinPts criterion are classified as \"border points.\" Border points can be part of a cluster but are located on the edges of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Noise Points:** Data points that are neither core points nor border points are classified as \"noise points\" or outliers. These are data points that do not belong to any cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cluster Expansion:** The algorithm iteratively expands clusters by connecting core points and their density-reachable neighbors. Two core points are considered \"density-reachable\" if there is a path of core points connecting them within the epsilon distance. This process continues until no more core points can be added to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Result:** The output of DBSCAN is a set of clusters, each consisting of core points and potentially including border points. Noise points are not assigned to any cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN is a valuable algorithm for clustering spatial data when the characteristics of the clusters are not well-known in advance and is commonly used in various applications, including geospatial analysis, image processing, and anomaly detection. In this section, we look into DBSCAN to implement a simplified variant instead of the \"full\" algorithm. For this, let's first load some random data for visualization and testing."

In practice, we would likely remove those noise points, treat them separately, or maybe perform additional preprocessing steps to potentially \"denoise\" the dataset. However, the steps of choice generally depend heavily on the exact data mining task. Here, we focus on the identification of noise points."

    "### 1.1 Implementing DBSCAN for Noise Detection (10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we covered the original algorithm of DBSCAN, which you can also find on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). While not difficult to implement, it takes quite a couple of lines of codes to do so. For this assignment, however, we are only interested in the points of a dataset that DBSCAN considers noise (as illustrated above; the red dots in the previous plot). This includes that we do not have to care about\n",
    "\n",
    "* how many clusters there are (the plot above hints at 3 clusters but it does not matter) *and*\n",
    "* which non-noise points (the grey dots in the plot above) belong to which cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to implement a modified/simplified version of DBSCAN to find all noise points in a dataset!** The skeleton of method `get_noise_dbscan()` you need to complete is found in the file `cs5228_a2.py` (before the appropriate renaming). The method takes data matrix `X` as well as the two basic parameters `eps` and `min_samples` as input parameters; we use the same naming as scikit-learn's implementation of [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html).  The output should be 2 lists of indices: (a) one containing the indices of all *core points* and (b) on containing the indices of all *noise points* in input dataset X.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "* We only split this task into 2.1 a) and 2.1 b) to have intermediate results you can check for correctness (and potentially to better allow for partial marking). Our reference solutions first finds all core points and uses this information to find all noise points; hence the 2 separate code blocks for you to complete.\n",
    "* However, if you have a better/faster/shorter/cooler/etc. solution, you are more than welcome to implement it and ignore the intermediate result of finding all core points. Only the result from 2.1 b) is important. This also means that you can ignore 2.1 a) and still get full marks if you correctly identify all noise points.\n",
    "* If you have an alternative solution, please make sure that the method still returns the 2 output parameters `(core_point_indices, noise_point_indices)`. If you do not need to explicitly identify the core points, you can simply return `None` for `core_point_indices`.\n",
    "* You can import any method `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, or `pandas` has to offer -- except for any ready-made implementation of DBSCAN, of course :). Please add any imports to the code cell at the top with the other imports. Hint: We already imported [`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html) for you.\n",

    "## 2 AGNES\n",
    "\n",
    "AGNES, which stands for Agglomerative Nesting, is an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm used in data analysis and machine learning. It is a bottom-up approach to clustering, meaning it starts with individual data points as separate clusters and iteratively merges them into larger clusters. Here's an overview of how the AGNES clustering algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization:** Initially, each data point is treated as a single cluster, resulting in as many clusters as there are data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agglomerative Process:** AGNES proceeds by iteratively merging the two closest clusters into a single larger cluster. The distance between clusters is typically determined by a linkage criterion, which can be one of the following commonly used methods: *Single Linkage*, *Complete Linkage*, *Average Linkage*, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hierarchy Building:** As clusters are merged, a hierarchy or dendrogram is built to represent the sequence of cluster mergers. This dendrogram can be used to visualize the hierarchical structure of the data and choose the desired number of clusters later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stopping Criterion:** AGNES continues merging clusters until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be based on a predetermined number of clusters, a threshold distance, or other criteria. By default, AGNES stops when all data points form a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Result:** The output of AGNES is a hierarchical tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which can be cut at a specific level to obtain a partition of the data into clusters. The choice of where to cut the dendrogram depends on the desired number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "AGNES is a valuable tool for hierarchical clustering and can be useful in various data analysis tasks, including taxonomy construction, gene expression analysis, and image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Interpreting Dendrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the lecture that dendrograms are a meaningful way to visualize the hierarchical relationships between the data points with respect to the clustering using AGNES (or any other hierarchical clustering technique).

    "## 3 Association Rule Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rule mining is a data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, or associations in large datasets. It primarily focuses on identifying frequent patterns, often in the form of rules, within transactional or relational databases. This technique is commonly applied in various fields, including market basket analysis in retail, web usage mining, healthcare, and more. Here's how association rule mining works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transaction Data:** Association rule mining typically starts with a dataset that represents transactions or events. Each transaction consists of a set of items, and these transactions are often stored in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Itemsets:** An itemset is a collection of one or more items or attributes from the dataset. For example, in a retail context, an itemset could be a list of products purchased together in a single transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Support:** Support is a measure of the frequency with which an itemset appears in the dataset. It is defined as the proportion of transactions that contain the itemset. High support indicates that the itemset is a common pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Confidence:** Confidence is a measure of how often the rule is found to be true. It is defined as the proportion of transactions that contain both the antecedent and the consequent. High confidence suggests a strong association between the antecedent and consequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lift:** Lift is a measure of how much more likely the consequent is given the antecedent compared to its expected occurrence by chance. A lift value greater than 1 suggests a positive association, while a value less than 1 suggests a negative or weak association.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Association Rules:** Association rules are typically expressed as \"if-then\" statements. They describe relationships between itemsets. Each rule consists of two parts:\n",
    "    * Antecedent (Left-hand side, LHS): This is the itemset that represents the condition or premise of the rule.\n",
    "    * Consequent (Right-hand side, RHS): This is the itemset that represents the result or conclusion of the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The association rule mining process involves finding itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold and then generating rules based on those itemsets. Rules are evaluated based on their confidence and lift, and interesting or meaningful rules are selected for further analysis or action. For example, in a retail context, association rule mining might reveal that customers who purchase items like bread and milk (antecedent) are highly likely to also purchase butter (consequent). This insight can be valuable for marketing and inventory management, as it suggests items that can be promoted together or placed in close proximity in the store. Association rule mining algorithms, such as the Apriori algorithm, are commonly used to efficiently discover and analyze these patterns in large datasets."

This means that the rules in Run A have a lower degree of confidence in predicting a positive test result but a higher lift when compared to B. The lower confidence in Run A is likely due to the broader range of symptom combinations that meet the minimum support threshold. In contrast, in Run B, the higher minimum support (0.15) and minimum confidence (0.8) criteria lead to more strict rule selection, resulting in rules with higher confidence but lower lift(strong association). These rules are more reliable in predicting a positive test result but may capture fewer symptom combinations, potentially missing some less frequent but still relevant patterns. "
